# This is where I am going to list in comments the things I think need to be done.

# Add a new patient
# This will need to be a form to take down identifying info
# Should likely hash the SSN
# Will need SSN, name, gender, date of birth, address, telephone number
# Assign a primary physician
# This should be a form


# View patient information
# Will likely need a search for the patient's name and DoB, or SSN.
# Should show personal info and medical history if it exists.

# Schedule an appointment with a doctor
# Check the available physicians and times available from schedule_job_shift
# Make sure there is no overlap with consultations
# Insert information into the consultations table

# Check previous diagnoses and Illnesses
# Run the search against patient_illness with a join on illnesses to get
# the illness name and description

# View scheduled per doctor and per day
# Check consultations and provide a view on consultations for accuracy
